Eric Ritchey COSC362 Test Question

Which of the following is the proper command to allow the file 'tables.txt' to be 
readable by everyone, executable by nobody, and writeable by only the author?

a. chmod 740 tables.txt
b. chmod 470 tables.txt
c. chmod 570 tables.txt
d. chmod 057 tables.txt

## ABOVE IS WRONG

This question is wrong. For each group (Owner, Group, Public) each have 3 attributes. Readable, Writable, Executable. Your question suggests it is readable by everyone, executable by nobody, and only writable by the owner. Therefore, the answer would be the following:

OWNER       GROUP         PUBLIC
RWE         RWE           RWE
420         400           400
 6           4             4 
 
 ## ANSWER: chmod 644 tables.txt
